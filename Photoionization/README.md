## 🔬 Projects Overview

### 🛰 iSALE (Hypervelocity Impact)

Simulations and analysis of **hypervelocity impacts** using the iSALE shock physics code. Includes crater formation, pressure decay, and mesh sensitivity studies.

**Sample notebooks:**
- `240326_cratergrowth.ipynb`
- `240411 asteroid.ipynb`
- `240324 Grid_Spacing.ipynb`

---

### 💡 P4P (Laser Irradiation)

Analysis of **laser-driven particle plume (P4P)** experiments. These studies simulate micro-scale impacts and plasma plume behavior in laboratory settings.

**Sample notebooks:**
- `trace_laser.ipynb`
- `250113_analysis_laser.ipynb`
- `241125_analysis.ipynb`

### ☀️ Photoionization

Study of **photoionization phenomena** under UV/X-ray radiation, relevant to early planetary atmospheres and interstellar molecular chemistry.  
This section includes a **custom-built physical model** of photon–molecule interaction and plasma generation, implemented and visualized from scratch.

> ⚡️ `PI.ipynb` demonstrates a self-developed physics-based simulation model for photon-induced ionization and time-dependent plasma evolution — designed for interpretability and expandability.

**Sample notebooks:**
- `PI.ipynb` ← ✅ Custom simulation model
- `QMS_analysis.ipynb` ← Quantitative data analysis from mass spectrometry
