# ☄️ Astrobiology Research – P4P (Laser Irradiation)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing **laser irradiation experiments** using the P4P (Photon-for-Planet) setup. The focus is on interpreting particle motion and pressure evolution after intense laser interactions with target materials.

## 🧪 Project Context

These experiments simulate **hypervelocity impacts** or **astrobiological processes** by focusing high-energy lasers onto sample surfaces, generating transient plasma and shockwave dynamics. The notebooks below help trace particle motion, analyze shock propagation, and calculate experimental parameters from the data.

## 📊 Methods Used

- Image-based trajectory tracking
- Data smoothing and polynomial fitting
